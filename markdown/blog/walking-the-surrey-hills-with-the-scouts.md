This week has been one of those awkward weeks where everyone has wanted a piece of my time and for no real consequence. You see freelancing can be a weird thing at times and that is why it has been a struggle to write a regular post this week for the blog, not so much due to time constraints but my poor old head has been sent into a spin. I’ve lost my focus and have a dose of writers block. Oh heck.

Managing time can be so hard, starting projects and finishing them often harder. The same can be said for articles, so here is what I tried to do, I had started with the right intentions to write about my favourite walking boots and then I tried writing about something else. So my Ode to my boots fell flat on it’s face, so that one can go in the drafts folder for awhile...

This week I do have some spare time, yippee. I am taking the week off but will be spending some time on my “The Rambling Photographer” project, one of the new blogs I have just kicked off. Let me tell you a little more about it...

The UK comprises of thousands of miles of long distance paths, bridleways, towpaths and so on, that lead through so many wonderfully photogenic locations, ranging from villages to cities passing along our rivers, through valleys and miles upon miles of glorious countryside. I am not planning on walking thousands of miles, that would take multiple lifetimes but I can take a little taster of each where I can. I want to inspire others by taking on each walk gradually over time and to write about my experiences.

The website will present many of these walks as guides that you can follow but at the same time the blog will reveal little bits of the walks long before the main content is complete and ready for publishing, so that keeps the tempo of the overall website up beat and keeping a good rhythm. 

Whilst on the topic of walking and hiking; Last weekend was great by the way, as I took on the longest walk I’ve done in a long time, it totalled 15 miles, started at around 9am and finished just before 4pm as the light was going! Long story short, my Wife is a Scout Leader and I stepped in to cover for one of the leaders who couldn’t attend the Hike. It was a tough one because we crossed some rugged parts of the Surrey Hills where I had to clamber some tough hills, which I’m not all that used to nor did I believe I’d be fit enough to conquer but as it turned out I did just fine.

We set out from Guildford station and begun by walking along the towpath of the River Wey in heavy rain. The paths were all extremely muddy and in places as we progressed into the hilly areas, I would not be exaggerating in saying that some had become streams in themselves cascading down from the hills. We all ploughed on, almost literally but thankfully we all were prepared like all good Scouts in kitting ourselves out with decent waterproof clothing, rucksacks and walking boots. It got to the point where we simply didn’t care anymore, with even the wimpier kids (that does sound mean but they need to toughen up a bit!) who were grumbling at the start slowly began to appreciate the daft adventure we had found ourselves embarking on. I think they got something out of it which was great.

I had been stressing over many stupid things that week, such as do I have enough material for Write52, the blog in general, the prospect of running multiple blogs in parallel on very different subjects. I was worried about not having enough to do for another project, the one that pays the mortgage and that the contract might be fizzling out. Christmas coming up and no shopping done. A scary hospital appointment in two weeks time. Nah! I didn’t care, it had all fizzled out! I was enjoying the endurance adventure I found myself on and it is interesting not just what you can learn about other people on these days out but yourself.

I have for many years fought with fear for not being up to the grade when it comes to fitness and I have good reason to. I am after all a Kidney failure survivor, 11 years ago I had a transplant which changed my life, my outlook on it and many things besides but recently I felt as if I was relapsing, not with kidney failure (glad to say it is filtering my oil nicely) but more of a self esteem collapse. I couldn’t walk 15 miles, I get pains in my legs because of the side-effects of immunosuppressant medication. Truth is I do but the reality of it is, I have succumbed to believing this to be the reason when it is not. I can bloody well do it and I damn well did on Saturday last week. I was so proud as we crossed the finish line, well there wasn’t one just more of a muddy field with a car park the other side and no spectators. I was soaked, cold and a little bit tired but somehow that evening I managed to find some energy and drive us all home to a nice warm house, finally hitting the sack at midnight.  

Around the time of my transplant, my Dad (who was my live donor) and I came up with the idea to walk part of the South West Coast path in stages, we have never got around to it. I dearly want to do it. However I fret over being a freelancer and drop more excuse bombs in my path to success! I have got the walking bug again and want to do some serious walks soon which I will share along with my photography too.

On a slightly different subject, we are currently preparing for a Kruger National Park trip in March which follows on from a family wedding in that part of the World too, so super excited about that. In the meantime I am going to take on more tough hills and this will help a great deal in getting some fabulous landscape shots wherever these adventures take us in the years to come.

I seriously didn't think I'd get anything out of the door today but here it is. Apologies to those at Write52 if I've missed the newsletter, I will certainly set time aside to get some new pots started this week and to have some spares for future crazy weeks!
