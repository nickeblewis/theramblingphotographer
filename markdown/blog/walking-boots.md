If you enjoy walking and photography and you want to spend as much time outdoors capturing images, then do yourself a massive favour, treat yourself to good footwear. There is no substitute for a great pair of walking boots when it comes to rambling, hiking or whatever you wish to call it. Let's take a look at some of the key ingredients for what you should look for in a pair of boots!

Now before I get into the nitty gritty of boots, my favourite pair are made by Clarks and are over 15 years old and I can't see them falling apart anytime soon. They are just so good.

This isn't a review of any particular brands but if you ever want me to review outdoor products, drop me a line and we can arrange something.

Let's go!

## Comfort
It goes without saying that if you are going to be walking for any significant length of time, comfort is an important factor. Only problem being that when in the shop trying products out, it is hard to gauge since you can't really tell how comfortable the footwear will be after a prolonged period. Ok they are comfortable when you put them on and do ten paces around your local shoe shop, but will they carry you all the way up your next hill or mountain?

I tend to check how snug the fit is around my heel and the sides of my feet, as I raise my heel does the boot slip? If so it may cause blistering after a period of time, although that can be prevented through the use of thicker socks, which always works for me, especially during these bitter winter months and I wish to carry on braving the elements and getting out there!

## Good support
Following on from comfort, good support matters and in some cases I've found adding an extra insole can support the arches of your feet but this really depends on - well your feet, as we are all different.

I would like to add that recently I slipped up whilst out on a hike and twisted my ankle in the process. Strangely it didn't hurt for the remainder of the walk but gave me some grief the following day. I credit this too my boots having good ankle support which also protected me from spraining it badly.

Stumbling aside, good support plus grip helps with balance as you traverse tricky paths where you might encounter rocks, ruts in the ground and other distorted surfaces. That extra stability gives you the confidence to get across tricky bits without fear of doing yourself injury.
