title: The April Garden
summary: Here at TRP we are totally stuck much like everyone else and no walks are taking place beyond the household. So I thought it would be a good idea to explore my very own garden...

## Garden Plants

Our garden is looking absolutely glorious right now and over the past 3 weeks I've taken an assortment of photographs of it during my gardening sessions. Most of the photos in this set were taken using a 70-200mm lens to attain the desired depth of field, basically as shallow as possible, so that I blur out the distracting stuff in the garden. Who wants to see the airer for example? None of you, that's for sure!

Tulips, Hyacinths, Primroses and burgeoning bluebells are all vying for their photosynthesis right now, as the long, warm days ensue.

## Wildlife

We have been very organised with our bird feeding over the past year and I think that as a consequence the local wildlife population has been writing very favourable reviews on their equivalent of Tripadvisor. 

> "The Mealworms are the best in town", quoted Bertie the Blackbird in one issue of "Good Grub" Magazine. 

Meanwhile Richard, the Robin (yes odd name for a Robin, I know) was tweeting from the tree-tops how much he was loving the continental style breakfasts we've been laying on all winter and spring so far.

Would you believe that Foxes love slightly wrinkly grapes, who would've known?

Humbug, our cat doesn't seem to chase any of the garden visitors anymore and they all have twigged, so don't seem to give a damn when she is on the prowl. Those pesky Squirrels know how to wind her up and they love to tackle the highest meal available on our smorgasbord, the fat. I think they need it by the time they've deftly scrambled up the feeding station.
