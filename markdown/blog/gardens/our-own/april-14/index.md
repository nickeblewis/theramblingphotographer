summary: Here at TRP we are totally stuck much like everyone else and no walks are taking place beyond the household. So I thought it would be a good idea to explore my very own garden...

## Garden Plants

Our garden is looking absolutely glorious right now and over the past 3 weeks I've taken an assortment of photographs of it during my gardening sessions. Most of the photos in this set were taken using a 70-200mm lens to attain the desired depth of field, basically as shallow as possible, so that I blur out the distracting stuff in the garden. Who wants to see the airer for example? None of you, that's for sure!

Tulips, Hyacinths, Primroses and burgeoning bluebells are all vying for their photosynthesis right now, as the long, warm days ensue.
